Recent updates to Postman no longer make it possible to export collection as V1 which means you cannot upload them directly to he Power Automate custom connector site.  Luckily there is a site [APIMATIC](https://www.apimatic.io/) which allows you to convert the Postman 2.0 collection to just about any other format you want.  You can downgrade them to Postman 1.0 or you could convert them to OpenAPI 2.0 format which you can also directly upload to the Power Automate connector page.
