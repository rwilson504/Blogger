There are many tools you can utilize to develop Power Automate custom connectors including [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Swagger Inspector](https://inspector.swagger.io/builder).  I prefer to utilize Postman but recent updates to the product no longer make it possible to export to a v1 collection.

Unfortunately the Power Automate custom connector site only allows the v1 collections.

Luckily [APIMATIC](https://www.apimatic.io/) allows you to convert the Postman 2.0 collection to just about any other format you want.  You can downgrade them to Postman 1.0 or you could convert them to OpenAPI 2.0 format which you can also directly upload to the Power Automate connector page.
