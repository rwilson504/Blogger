Dedicated to developers seeking to bridge the Power Platform with government data sources, it provides best practices, tools, and insights to streamline development and ensure secure, effective integration. This approach ensures that custom connectors are not only efficiently developed but also fully utilize the capabilities and data provided by government APIs.

## Part I: Guidelines for Government API Developers

### Best Practices for Government API Developers

Developing APIs with a focus on ease of integration into custom connectors is crucial for maximizing the utility of government data. A well-designed API not only facilitates seamless connectivity but also enhances user experiences by providing clear, efficient access to data.

#### Why Building on Standards Like OpenAPI Is Important

The Power Platform connectors, along with Logic Apps, utilize the OpenAPI standard, emphasizing its significance in creating adaptable and interoperable APIs. OpenAPI offers a language-agnostic way to describe RESTful APIs, which can be used to generate code-stubs and documentation. This specification plays a pivotal role in decoupling the public interface of an API from its implementation details, allowing business and design teams to outline the features they need independently of the engineering team's work.

- **Design-First Approach**: OpenAPI allows for the API to be defined with types and examples for every endpoint before implementation. This design-first approach facilitates refining API design by iterating over the specification document, ensuring the API meets both business requirements and technical constraints.

- **Code Generators and Tooling**: The OpenAPI ecosystem provides tools to create mock APIs, generate documentation, tests, and server stubs. This accelerates the API development process, making it easier for front-end developers to work with a practical interface even before the back-end is fully implemented.

- **Huge Userbase and Stable Implementation**: Backed by many large organizations, OpenAPI represents condensed knowledge from thousands of APIs developed over the years. Its stable implementation and wide adoption provide a reliable foundation for building modern APIs.

- **Facilitating Better Engineering and Usage**: Standards provide a common framework of communication and development, helping to pick the right tools based on specific needs. The OpenAPI Specification, in particular, aids in building consumer-centric APIs by ensuring a good developer experience through a definition-driven approach.

Incorporating OpenAPI standards into the development of government APIs is instrumental in achieving interoperability, ensuring security, and enhancing the overall quality of digital services. It lays a solid foundation for APIs that not only serve the intended purpose efficiently but are also easier to use, document, and integrate with platforms like the Power Platform.

By adopting a standardized approach to API development, government developers can ensure their APIs are robust, scalable, and ready to meet the evolving needs of both internal and external consumers. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also paves the way for a more connected and efficient digital government infrastructure.

### The Importance of Unique Paths in API Design

- **Design Considerations**: Ensure that each operation within your API has a unique path. This clarity in design helps custom connector developers to create precise actions, allowing end-users to efficiently target the information they need. The OpenAPI specification emphasizes that a path can only be used once per method, although you can have multiple operations (HTTP methods) for each path. This specification underlines the necessity of segregating your API into distinct actions/paths during development. Utilizing a single path to retrieve different data types can lead to confusion and complicate the user experience.

- **OpenAPI Specification Guidance**: According to the [Swagger definition website for OpenAPI 2.0](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/paths-and-operations/), paths serve as the unique identifiers for operations within an API, and employing unique paths ensures that the API's structure remains clear and logical. Adhering to this specification aids developers in avoiding functional overlaps within the API, thereby simplifying navigation and usage of the API through custom connectors.

### Publishing API Definitions

Make your OpenAPI definitions publicly available, as exemplified by various GSA APIs, to simplify the development of custom connectors. Providing these definitions enables developers to quickly understand and integrate your API’s capabilities into the Power Platform, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

- Example: The [Site Scanning API by GSA](https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api/#openapi-specification-file) offers its OpenAPI specification file for download, facilitating an excellent starting point for connector development.

### Guidance for Implementing Effective Pagination in APIs for Power Platform

For APIs to be fully compatible with Power Platform and Logic Apps, supporting built-in paging functionality is crucial. This involves designing your API to return paginated responses that adhere to a specific structure, enabling Power Platform to correctly navigate through data sets across multiple pages. Below are the key requirements and examples for structuring your API responses for effective pagination.

#### Requirements for Returning Paginated Responses (JSON)

1. **nextLink**: Include a `nextLink` property in the JSON response body, which contains the URI for accessing the next page of results. This property should be present only when there are more pages to fetch. If there are no additional pages, omit the `nextLink` property.

2. **value**: The response must have a `value` array that houses the results for the current page. The objects within this array represent the actual data items retrieved by the API.

3. **HTTP Response Code**: Use the HTTP status code `200` for successful paginated responses, indicating that the data has been successfully returned.

#### Example Paginated API Responses

To illustrate, consider an API that returns data about various entities, each with `Name` and `Description` attributes. The following examples show how the API should handle pagination across different responses:

**Response #1 (First Page):**

```json
{
  "nextLink": "http://example.com/api/entities?page=2",
  "value": [
    {
      "Name": "Entity1",
      "Description": "Description of Entity1"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity2",
      "Description": "Description of Entity2"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response #2 (Second Page):**

```json
{
  "nextLink": "http://example.com/api/entities?page=3",
  "value": [
    {
      "Name": "Entity3",
      "Description": "Description of Entity3"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response #3 (Final Page):**

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "Name": "Entity4",
      "Description": "Description of Entity4"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity5",
      "Description": "Description of Entity5"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Logic App Task Output (Aggregated Results):**

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "Name": "Entity1",
      "Description": "Description of Entity1"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity2",
      "Description": "Description of Entity2"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity3",
      "Description": "Description of Entity3"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity4",
      "Description": "Description of Entity4"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Entity5",
      "Description": "Description of Entity5"
    }
  ]
}

```

2. **Review the OpenAPI File**: Familiarize yourself with the file's contents, identifying any areas lacking in detail that could benefit from further clarification, especially for low-code developers.

3. **Using ChatGPT to Fill in the Details**:
    - After identifying what's missing, particularly in terms of extended properties, the next step involves leveraging ChatGPT to generate these details. Due to processing limitations, it's often necessary to break down the task into smaller, more manageable segments.
    - **Approach**:
        - **Individual Path Processing**: Begin by inputting individual API paths into ChatGPT, asking it to generate missing summary, description, and other relevant attributes for each. This piecemeal approach helps avoid overwhelming ChatGPT and ensures more accurate outputs.
        - **Sequential Processing**: For APIs with multiple paths, consider processing them sequentially. Start with the first path, then proceed to the next, and so on. This method allows for focused enhancement of each part of the API definition.
    - **Sample Prompt**: Here's an example prompt used for generating extended attributes for an API path:

      ```markdown
      Acting as a Power Platform developer, I would like your assistance in writing a custom connector. I will provide each path for the API. Include the following:
      
      * A summary and description attributes for each path. 
      * A description, and x-ms-summary attribute for each path parameter and response property; the x-ms-summary should read like a title for the name field.
      * A title, description, and x-ms-summary attribute for each response property; the title and x-ms-summary will be the same.  
      * If the name attribute is used in the description, then update the description to use the new title attribute.
      
      Information on those attributes can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/openapi-extensions. Please update the file with those additional attributes and provide it back to me.
      
      Here is the first one.

      ... <<paste the first past here>>
      ```

    Utilizing this prompt, you can guide ChatGPT to produce the necessary extensions and attributes, tailoring the OpenAPI file to better suit low-code development needs within the Power Platform.

By methodically enhancing the OpenAPI definition with detailed attributes through ChatGPT, you streamline the development process, offering a guided and simplified experience for developers engaging with your custom connector.

#### Step 3: Enhancing the OpenAPI File with Contact and Product Metadata

For independent publishers, it's crucial to enrich the OpenAPI definition file with detailed contact information and additional product or end service metadata. This enhancement ensures users of your custom connector have comprehensive support resources and insights into the product or service behind the connector.

##### Adding Contact Information

Incorporate your contact details within the `info` section of the OpenAPI file. This inclusion offers users a direct channel for support, feedback, or inquiries:

```json
"info": {
    "title": "GSA Site Scanning API",
    "description": "This API provides information about sites in the federal web presence, enabling users to scan and retrieve data efficiently.",
    "version": "2.0",
    "contact": {
      "name": "Richard Wilson",
      "email": "richard.a.wilson@microsoft.com",
      "url": "https://www.richardawilson.com/"
    }
}
```

##### Incorporating Product Metadata

Add metadata concerning the product or service associated with the connector, such as support details, privacy policy, and categorization. These details are crucial for enhancing user understanding and trust. Utilize the x-ms-connector-metadata extension for this purpose:

```json
"x-ms-connector-metadata": [
  {
    "propertyName": "Website",
    "propertyValue": "https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api"
  },
  {
    "propertyName": "Privacy policy",
    "propertyValue": "https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/digital-strategy/terms-of-service-for-developer-resources"
  },
  {
    "propertyName": "Categories",
    "propertyValue": "IT Operations"
  }
]
```

The `contact` object within the `info` section and the `x-ms-connector-metadata` extension should be meticulously detailed, as shown above. The `Categories` property must accurately represent the connector's logical classification, using a semicolon-delimited string from the following categories: AI, Business Management, Business Intelligence, Collaboration, Commerce, Communication, Content and Files, Finance, Data, Human Resources, Internet of Things, IT Operations, Lifestyle and Entertainment, Marketing, Productivity, Sales and CRM, Security, Social Media, Website.

To ensure the accuracy and relevance of product metadata included in your OpenAPI file, the best resources are the API publisher's website and official API documentation. This is why it's crucial for publishers to provide comprehensive information about their product or service, including support resources, privacy policies, and categorization details. Equally, for consumers aiming to create custom connectors, selecting APIs that offer this information is pivotal. This approach not only facilitates the creation of more reliable and user-friendly connectors but also promotes transparency and trust within the user community. By prioritizing APIs with well-documented product metadata, both publishers and consumers contribute to a more informed and efficient ecosystem within the Power Platform.

By integrating these contact and product metadata details into your OpenAPI file, you not only adhere to the publishing requirements for independent publishers but also significantly improve the connector's discoverability, transparency, and trustworthiness among users.

#### Step 4: Good Practices in Setting the Consumes and Produces Attributes

Defining the `consumes` and `produces` attributes in your OpenAPI specification is crucial. These attributes indicate the MIME types your API can accept and return, respectively:

Best Practices
For APIs dealing exclusively with JSON data, explicitly specifying `application/json` for both `consumes` and `produces` attributes is crucial. This ensures that the API and client applications correctly handle content types:

```json
consumes: ["application/json"],
produces: ["application/json"]
```

Setting these attributes correctly ensures data formats are properly understood and handled, promoting consistency and reliability in data exchange.

#### Step 5: Addressing Pagination Issues with Custom Logic in Power Automate Flows

To enable effective pagination in the GSA Site Scanning API through Power Automate flows, incorporate `limit` and `page` parameters into your requests. These parameters should be defined in your OpenAPI file with precision, ensuring seamless integration and use within the Power Platform.

##### Adding Pagination Parameters to the OpenAPI File

Define the `limit` and `page` parameters in the OpenAPI file as follows, ensuring they align with the standard structure used for other parameters:

```json
"parameters": [
  {
    "name": "limit",
    "in": "query",
    "required": false,
    "description": "Specifies the number of items to return in a single page of results.",
    "x-example": "10",
    "type": "integer",
    "x-ms-summary": "Limit"
  },
  {
    "name": "page",
    "in": "query",
    "required": false,
    "description": "Specifies the page number of the results to retrieve.",
    "x-example": "1",
    "type": "integer",
    "x-ms-summary": "Page"
  }
]
```

#### Step 6: Converting the OpenAPI 3.0 File to Swagger 2.0 Format

The Power Platform requires custom connector definitions to be in Swagger 2.0 format. If your OpenAPI definition file is in version 3.0, you'll need to convert it before proceeding with the import. There are a few tools available for this conversion:

1. **Using Apimatic's Transform API Function**: Apimatic offers a convenient [Transform API](https://app.apimatic.io/) function that allows you to easily convert between different API specification formats, including from OpenAPI 3.0 to Swagger 2.0. Simply upload your OpenAPI 3.0 file, select the target format (Swagger 2.0), and download the converted file.

2. **Utilizing the api-spec-converter Command Line Tool**: For those who prefer working from the command line or need to integrate this step into automated workflows, the [api-spec-converter](https://github.com/LucyBot-Inc/api-spec-converter) tool available on GitHub is an excellent resource.
