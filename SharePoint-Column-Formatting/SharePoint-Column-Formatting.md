## Power App/SharePoint solution for managing large collections of files

Although most of the time I'm telling poeple to use Dataverse and stop using SharePoint for Power Apps there are sometimes use cases that do fit the latter.  One case can be storing large collections of documents, something SharePoint is really good at.  The use case below utilizes Document Sets and Column formatting withing SharePoint as well as Power Apps and Power Automate to generate a Document Set.
