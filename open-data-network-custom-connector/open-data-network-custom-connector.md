# Introducing the Open Data Network Connector for Power Platform

## Introduction
In this blog post, I'm excited to introduce the new Open Data Network connector for Power Platform. This powerful tool opens up access to a vast repository of government data, enabling developers, businesses, and public sector organizations to integrate valuable information into their applications and services. Discover how this connector can enhance your data analysis capabilities and streamline access to essential datasets.

## Understanding the Open Data Network and Tyler Technologies
### Overview of the Open Data Network (ODN)
The Open Data Network (ODN) is a collaborative initiative aimed at democratizing access to government data. Partnering with Tyler Technologies, ODN supports over 700 federal, state, and local agencies in publishing their data. This collaboration ensures data from a wide range of sources is available for public use, driving transparency and fostering innovation.

### Role of Tyler Technologies and Socrata
Tyler Technologies is a leader in public sector software solutions, providing the infrastructure and expertise needed to manage and disseminate vast amounts of data. In 2018, Tyler Technologies acquired Socrata, a pioneer in open data solutions. This acquisition allowed Tyler Technologies to integrate Socrata’s resources and expertise, further enhancing their ability to support data publishing and accessibility.

### Scale of the Network
- **Number of Agencies:** Over 700 federal, state, and local agencies contribute data to the ODN.
- **Number of Datasets:** Tens of thousands of datasets are hosted on the ODN.
- **Examples of Contributing Agencies:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Transportation, and more.

## Obtaining Credentials for the Connector
To start using the Open Data Network connector, you'll need to obtain an App Token or an API Key. Here’s how:

### Generating App Tokens and API Keys
An App Token is all that's required for read access to data. For users who need to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on datasets or access datasets that have been specifically shared with them, an API Key and Secret are necessary.

#### What is an App Token?
An Application Token is an alphanumeric string that authorizes you to create an application. App tokens can be used as part of the authentication process to perform read operations through the API. Data & Insights users can leverage the app tokens to manage API call limits and throttling.

#### What is an API Key?
API Keys can be used to perform read, write, and delete operations through the API, according to the user’s role on the domain they are accessing. An API Key comes with a secret key, serving as a proxy for a user's username and password. The advantage of using an API Key + Secret Key is that it allows authentication without displaying the username, and it remains unchanged even if the user's Data & Insights password changes.

### Steps to Obtain App Tokens and API Keys
1. Log into your Data & Insights account on any Data & Insights domain, such as evergreen.data.socrata.com.
2. Navigate to your profile page by selecting the profile icon on the header bar.
3. Select "Developer Settings" and click "Create New App Token."
4. Fill in the required details and save your app token.

For detailed steps, refer to this guide on [Generating App Tokens and API Keys](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys#:~:text=Obtaining%20an%20App%20Tokens%20and,icon%20on%20the%20header%20bar).

Keep your API Key Secret secure, as it will not be shown again after creation. Using an API key will allow you to access datasets that have been shared with you. For more details, see the "Obtaining Credentials" section in the readme file.

## Getting Data from a Dataset
Using the Open Data Network connector, you can easily retrieve data from various datasets. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Search Catalog:** Find datasets using various filters such as categories, tags, domain names, and more.
2. **Search Open Data Network Assets:** Use this action to search across all available resources and find the data sources you need.
3. **Search with SoQL:** Execute SoQL queries to get data from a dataset.

### Example Workflow
1. Create a new flow in Power Platform.
2. Add the Open Data Network connector.
3. Use the "Search Catalog" operation to find datasets related to public health.
4. Query the dataset and visualize the data in Power BI.

## Benefits for Data Analysts
The Open Data Network connector is a valuable addition to any data analyst's toolkit. By providing seamless access to a vast array of datasets, it empowers users to derive meaningful insights and drive better decision-making. Here are some of the different types of people who can benefit from this connector:
