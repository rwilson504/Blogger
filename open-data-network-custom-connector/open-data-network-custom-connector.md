## Introduction
In this blog post, I'm excited to introduce the new [Open Data Network](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) connector for Power Platform. This powerful tool opens up access to a vast repository of government data, enabling developers, businesses, and public sector organizations to integrate valuable information into their applications and services. Discover how this connector can enhance your data analysis capabilities and streamline access to essential datasets.

## Understanding the Open Data Network and Tyler Technologies
### Overview of the Open Data Network (ODN)
The Open Data Network (ODN) is a collaborative initiative aimed at democratizing access to government data. Partnering with Tyler Technologies, ODN supports over 700 federal, state, and local agencies in publishing their data. This collaboration ensures data from a wide range of sources is available for public use, driving transparency and fostering innovation.

### Role of Tyler Technologies and Socrata
[Tyler Technologies](https://www.tylertech.com/) is a leader in public sector software solutions, providing the infrastructure and expertise needed to manage and disseminate vast amounts of data. In 2018, Tyler Technologies acquired Socrata, a pioneer in open data solutions. This acquisition allowed Tyler Technologies to integrate Socrata’s resources and expertise, further enhancing their ability to support data publishing and accessibility.

### Scale of the Network
- **Number of Agencies:** Over 700 federal, state, and local agencies contribute data to the ODN.
- **Number of Datasets:** Tens of thousands of datasets are hosted on the ODN.
- **Examples of Contributing Agencies:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Transportation, and more.

## Practical Applications
The Open Data Network connector offers a multitude of practical applications across various sectors, empowering users to leverage public data for innovative solutions and better decision-making:

### Government Leadership
Governments at all levels—from cities to federal entities—can lead society by using public data to drive better decisions and provide innovative services. By turning public data into a utility, governments can fuel the economy and build trust with constituents through transparency and openness.

### Real-time Decision Making
With the connector, government agencies can transform outdated legacy systems into modern, cost-effective technology solutions. This enables real-time access to critical information and services, allowing for fact-based decision-making and efficient government operations.

### Enhanced Public Services
Access to open data allows government employees to provide enhanced citizen services, improving resident experiences through seamless, integrated service delivery. Data-driven insights help governments address public health trends, urban planning, and environmental changes more effectively.

### Transparency and Trust
Citizens today expect transparency regarding how their tax dollars are spent. Open data fosters trust between the government and the public by making essential information readily available. This transparency allows citizens to understand government actions and decisions better.

### Cross-departmental Collaboration
The centralized repository of open data facilitates collaboration across different government departments. Agencies can work together more efficiently by sharing data and insights, leading to more cohesive and effective problem-solving.

### Proactive Alerts
Data-driven governments can provide proactive, alert-driven experiences for citizens. For instance, residents can receive timely notifications on their smartphones about important issues related to their health, safety, and community, enhancing public engagement and awareness.

### Educational Improvements
In the education sector, open data can support the creation of safe and efficient school districts. Data analytics can enhance business administration, student information systems, and transportation safety, contributing to better student achievement and overall educational outcomes.

### Special Districts
Special districts can benefit from tailored data solutions that address unique needs such as revenue and expenditure management, specific workflows, and essential service delivery. Open data empowers these districts to operate more efficiently and effectively.

## Obtaining Credentials for the Connector
To start using the Open Data Network connector, you'll need to obtain an App Token or an API Key. Here’s how:

### Generating App Tokens and API Keys
An App Token is all that's required for read access to data. For users who need to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on datasets or access datasets that have been specifically shared with them, an API Key and Secret are necessary.

#### What is an App Token?
An Application Token is an alphanumeric string that authorizes you to create an application. App tokens can be used as part of the authentication process to perform read operations through the API. Data & Insights users can leverage the app tokens to manage API call limits and throttling.

#### What is an API Key?
API Keys can be used to perform read, write, and delete operations through the API, according to the user’s role on the domain they are accessing. An API Key comes with a secret key, serving as a proxy for a user's username and password. The advantage of using an API Key + Secret Key is that it allows authentication without displaying the username, and it remains unchanged even if the user's Data & Insights password changes.

### Steps to Obtain App Tokens and API Keys
1. Log into your Data & Insights account on any Data & Insights domain, such as evergreen.data.socrata.com.
2. Navigate to your profile page by selecting the profile icon on the header bar.
3. Select "Developer Settings" and click "Create New App Token."
4. Fill in the required details and save your app token.

For detailed steps, refer to this guide on [Generating App Tokens and API Keys](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys#:~:text=Obtaining%20an%20App%20Tokens%20and,icon%20on%20the%20header%20bar).

Keep your API Key Secret secure, as it will not be shown again after creation. Using an API key will allow you to access datasets that have been shared with you. For more details, see the "Obtaining Credentials" section in the readme file.

## Getting Data from a Dataset
Using the Open Data Network connector, you can easily retrieve data from various datasets. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Search Catalog:** Find datasets using various filters such as categories, tags, domain names, and more.
2. **Search Open Data Network Assets:** Use this action to search across all available resources and find the data sources you need.
3. **Search with SoQL:** Execute SoQL queries to get data from a dataset.

### Example Workflow
1. Create a new flow in Power Platform.
2. Add the Open Data Network connector.
3. Use the "Search Catalog" operation to find datasets related to public health.
4. Query the dataset and visualize the data in Power BI.

## Practical Applications
Imagine analyzing real-time data on infectious diseases, combining it with historical trends, and visualizing the results to predict future outbreaks. With the Open Data Network connector, such in-depth analysis becomes straightforward and efficient.

## Conclusion
The Open Data Network connector for Power Platform is a valuable addition to any data analyst's toolkit. By providing easy access to a wealth of government data, it empowers users to derive meaningful insights and drive better decision-making. Obtain your credentials today and start exploring the endless possibilities this connector offers.
