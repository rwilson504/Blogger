If you have custom applications built on Dynamics/Dataverse within the US Government Community Cloud (GCC) and only have Team user licenes that were purchased after October 2018 your apps screen may soon like like the one above.

These Team licenses were designed for access to very specific first party apps.
* Customer Service Team Member
* Sales Team Member
* Project Resource Hub

For a long time the restriction on these licenses in GCC had not had any sort of technical enforcement behind them but that is changing.  Restrictions are being put in place that will
ensure users can only utilize the first party apps listed above.

Additional information on the license enforcement can be found on the [Microsoft docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave1/dynamics365-sales/license-enforcement-users-new-team-member-licenses).

## What are the team license types?

To better understand what licenses you currently have in your environment let's take a look the different team licenses.  The image below shows you the display names of the different
team licenses available and what they can access.  As you can see there is a **Dynamics 365 for Team Members for Government** that has no restrictions.  These licenses were the ones purchased by organizations before October 2018.  If your users have this license you will not see any changes and your apps will continue to work correctly.  That being said upgrading these to Power Apps licenses can open up a lot of new opportunity.  If you have the **Dynamics 365 for Team Members for Government** or **PowerApps for Dynamics 365 Team Members for Government** you will soon be limited to limited first party apps.

## So what should i do?

**Don't get caught off guard** by losing access to your applications.  If you are utilizing the newer Teams licenses for apps not includes within the first party list get together with your Microsoft sales representative or [contact sales directly](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-Landing-PowerApps-Contact-Us.html?LCID=EN-US).  They can help you figure out what license options are available and which ones best fit your organizational needs.

Upgrading your organization to Power Apps licenses will also allow your organization to be part of the low code revolution.
