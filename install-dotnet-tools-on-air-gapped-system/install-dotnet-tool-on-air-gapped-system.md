In today's digital age, the vast majority of our tasks rely heavily on internet connectivity. However, there are scenarios, more common than one might think, where systems are intentionally kept offline for security or other reasons. These air-gapped or isolated systems, like Azure VMs in a restricted VNET, pose unique challenges, especially when it comes to software installation. One such challenge is installing .NET tools, a task that's straightforward with an internet connection but can become a complex endeavor without one. In this blog, we'll delve deep into the intricacies of using the dotnet command line reference to seamlessly install .NET tools on machines that don't have the luxury of internet access. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide aims to simplify the seemingly daunting process and equip you with the knowledge to conquer the offline world of .NET installations.

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of offline installations, it's essential to understand the foundational tools at our disposal. Central to our endeavor is the .NET SDK, a powerful suite that grants us the capability to harness the 'dotnet' command. With this command, we can perform a myriad of tasks, including the installation of .NET tools. But how do we achieve this without an active internet connection? The answer lies in NuGet packages. These packages, which are typically fetched from online repositories, can also be saved locally. By leveraging locally saved NuGet packages, we can sidestep the need for online connectivity, making it possible to install our desired .NET tools on air-gapped systems. In the sections that follow, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up the .NET SDK, accessing the 'dotnet' command, and utilizing local NuGet packages to achieve our installation goals.

# Step 1: Preparing for the Offline Journey
Remember, the key to a successful installation on an air-gapped system is thorough preparation. By ensuring you have all necessary files on hand and understanding the nuances of your isolated environment, you're setting yourself up for a smooth and hassle-free installation process.

## Downloading the .NET SDK:
Before anything else, you'll need the .NET SDK. This is the backbone that will allow you to run the 'dotnet' command on your air-gapped machine. Visit the official .NET SDK download page from a machine with internet access. Ensure you select the appropriate version and platform for your needs, then initiate the download.

## Gathering Required NuGet Packages:
Next, identify all the .NET tools you wish to install on the offline machine. For each tool, you'll need its corresponding NuGet package. Navigate to NuGet's official website and use the search functionality to locate each package. Once found, download the .nupkg file for the latest stable version, or the version you require.

## Transferring Files to the Air-Gapped Machine:
With the .NET SDK installer and the necessary NuGet packages in hand, you're now faced with the task of moving them to your offline environment. Before you proceed with the transfer, it's beneficial to establish a clear and organized folder structure to house these files. Here's a recommended approach:

### Creating a Structured Folder Hierarchy:
Start by creating a primary folder named packages. This will serve as the central repository for all your installation files. Within this packages folder, create a subfolder specifically for NuGet, aptly named nuget. This subfolder will hold all the .nupkg files you've downloaded. By maintaining this structure, not only do you ensure a neat and tidy directory, but it also simplifies the process of locating and managing packages in the future. Whether you choose to set up this structure directly on the air-gapped machine or on a local network drive accessible by the machine, consistency is key.

Once your folder hierarchy is in place, proceed to transfer the .NET SDK installer and the NuGet packages to their respective locations. The method you choose will depend on the tools and protocols available in your specific setup. Whether it's through USB drives, optical discs, or any other secure transfer method your organization permits, ensure the files are safely and completely transferred to the destination machine.
