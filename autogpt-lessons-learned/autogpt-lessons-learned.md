### Article Title: Revolutionizing Power Platform Custom Connectors with AI: A Journey of Innovation and Learning

### Introduction

In the realm of digital transformation, the integration of government APIs into the Power Platform stands as a beacon of efficiency and innovation. My previous endeavors, detailed in the ["Government API Development Playbook"](https://www.richardawilson.com/2024/02/government-api-development-playbook.html), laid the foundation for a journey towards more accessible and user-friendly interfaces for public services. Building upon this vision, I embarked on a new challenge: to revolutionize the creation process of custom connectors for US government APIs through the power of artificial intelligence.

The journey from manual to AI-assisted development was motivated by a simple yet profound goal: to reduce the build time from days to mere hours, thereby streamlining the deployment of these vital connectors. With ChatGPT, I found a partner that significantly accelerated our process, proving that AI could indeed play a pivotal role in this transformation. Encouraged by this success, I turned to AutoGPT, aiming for even greater efficiency and automation.

This article chronicles my adventure into the uncharted territories of AutoGPT, from the initial spark of inspiration to the hurdles that lay in wait. Despite facing technical challenges, navigating cost implications, and dealing with the intricacies of large OpenAPI files, the journey has been as enlightening as it has been challenging. Though not every goal was fully realized, the progress made offers a glimpse into a future where the creation of custom connectors is not just efficient but also seamlessly integrated with AI technologies.

Join me as we explore the lessons learned, the obstacles overcome, and the path forward in harnessing AI to serve the public good through enhanced Power Platform connectors.

### Overcoming Technical Challenges

#### Markdown Syntax and AutoGPT

**Challenge:** One of the first obstacles emerged when integrating Markdown syntax within AutoGPT prompts. The use of backticks (`) for code formatting inadvertently caused processing errors, hindering the ability to receive accurate responses from AutoGPT.

**Solution:** The resolution involved a two-pronged approach: refining the prompts to avoid direct use of problematic characters and implementing escape mechanisms for essential syntax. This adjustment required a careful review and alteration of prompt structures to ensure they were both effective and error-free.

**Insight:** This challenge underscored the importance of understanding the intricacies of AI parsing and the need for flexibility in prompt design. It served as a reminder that even minor syntactical elements can significantly impact AI interactions, highlighting the delicate balance between formatting needs and AI processing capabilities.

#### Managing Large OpenAPI Files

**Challenge:** The project hit a significant roadblock with AutoGPT's inability to process large OpenAPI files due to size limitations. This constraint threatened the feasibility of automating custom connector creation for comprehensive APIs.

**Solution:** To circumvent this limitation, a Python script was developed to split the OpenAPI files into smaller, manageable segments. This script meticulously divided the files by paths and definitions, allowing AutoGPT to process each segment individually without exceeding size constraints.

**Insight:** This approach not only solved the immediate problem but also introduced a scalable method for handling large files in AI-driven processes. It highlighted the value of breaking down complex tasks into simpler components, enabling more efficient and targeted AI analysis.

#### Content Analysis and Rule Crafting

**Challenge:** Initially, the project sought to directly analyze Microsoft Learn content with AutoGPT for insights on custom connector requirements. However, this method failed to yield coherent and actionable guidelines due to the complex and varied nature of the content.

**Solution:** A strategic pivot involved leveraging ChatGPT to first distill the essential information from Microsoft Learn pages into a set of clear, concise rules. These rules were then used to guide AutoGPT in its analysis and processing tasks, ensuring a more focused and effective approach.

**Insight:** This experience demonstrated the power of combining different AI tools to achieve a common goal. By using ChatGPT for content distillation and AutoGPT for task execution, it was possible to navigate around the limitations of direct content analysis, illustrating the benefits of a layered AI strategy.

#### Ensuring Error-Free Operations

**Challenge:** The project faced potential disruptions from errors during file manipulation tasks, particularly in reading, writing, and parsing JSON. Such errors could cause terminal crashes, significantly hampering progress.

**Solution:** To safeguard against these issues, a guideline was established for all operations to employ safe methods, such as try/catch blocks, ensuring that errors were gracefully handled and did not interrupt the process.

**Insight:** This precaution emphasized the critical role of robust error handling in software development, especially when integrating with AI technologies. It reinforced the principle that preventing errors is as crucial as solving them, underscoring the need for defensive programming practices in AI-assisted projects.

Each of these technical challenges, while presenting significant hurdles, also offered valuable lessons in the application of AI technologies to software development. Through innovative problem-solving and strategic use of AI tools, it was possible to advance the project while gaining insights that could benefit future endeavors in AI-assisted automation.
