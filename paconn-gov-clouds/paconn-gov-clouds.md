### Connecting the Paconn CLI Tool to GCC, GCCH, and DoD Environments for Power Platform Connectors

When working with the `paconn` CLI tool to create and manage custom connectors in the Power Platform, it's essential to configure your environment settings properly, especially when targeting different government cloud environments like GCC, GCC High, and DoD. In this article, we'll guide you through setting up these configurations, including creating a `connectionSettings.json` file for each environment, downloading a custom connector, and updating the connector's settings for seamless management.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription to register an application.
2. **Paconn CLI Tool**: Ensure you have the `paconn` CLI tool installed. You can install it using Python's pip:
   ```bash
   pip install paconn
   ```

### Step 1: Create an Azure App Registration

Begin by registering an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that will serve as the identity for your `paconn` operations.

1. **Navigate to Azure AD**: Sign in to the Azure portal and go to **Azure Active Directory**.
2. **Create a New App Registration**:
   - Go to **App registrations** > **New registration**.
   - Provide a name, such as "Paconn Connector App."
   - Select the supported account types relevant to your cloud environment (GCC, GCC High, DoD).
   - **Redirect URI**: Skip this step as it is not required.

3. **API Permissions**:
   - The app automatically includes the `User.Read` permission under Microsoft Graph. No additional API permissions are needed.

4. **Allow Public Client Flows**:
   - Under **Authentication** > **Advanced settings**, set **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**. This enables the device code flow, which `paconn` uses for authentication.

5. **Copy Your IDs**:
   - After registering the application, go to the **Overview** section.
   - Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. These values will be used in the `connectionSettings.json` file in the next step.

By the end of this step, you should have your **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** ready for configuring the connection settings in the following step.

### Step 2: Create the `connectionSettings.json` File

Next, you'll create a `connectionSettings.json` file with specific values tailored for each environment. This file is crucial for authenticating and operating within your selected cloud.

#### GCC Environment

```json
{
  "powerAppsUrl": "https://gov.api.powerapps.us/",
  "flowUrl": "https://gov.api.flow.microsoft.us/",  
  "resource": "https://gov.service.powerapps.us/",
  "authorityUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
  "clientId": "<Your Application (client) ID>",
  "tenant": "<Your Directory (tenant) ID>"
}
```

#### GCC High Environment

```json
{
  "powerAppsUrl": "https://high.api.powerapps.us/",
  "flowUrl": "https://high.api.flow.microsoft.us/",
  "resource": "https://high.service.powerapps.us/",
  "authorityUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.us/",
  "clientId": "<Your Application (client) ID>",
  "tenant": "<Your Directory (tenant) ID>"
}
```

#### DoD Environment

```json
{
  "powerAppsUrl": "https://api.apps.appsplatform.us/",
  "flowUrl": "https://api.flow.appsplatform.us/",
  "resource": "https://service.apps.appsplatform.us/",
  "authorityUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.us/",
  "clientId": "<Your Application (client) ID>",
  "tenant": "<Your Directory (tenant) ID>"
}
```

Replace `<Your Application (client) ID>` and `<Your Directory (tenant) ID>` with the values from your Azure App Registration.

### Step 3: Download a Custom Connector

Once your `connectionSettings.json` file is set up, you can download an existing custom connector from your environment using the following command:

```bash
paconn download --connector <connector-name> --connection-settings connectionSettings.json
```

This command downloads the specified connector along with its associated `settings.json` file.

### Step 4: Update the `settings.json` File

After downloading a connector, it's important to update the `settings.json` file with the appropriate values from your `connectionSettings.json` file. This ensures consistency when managing the connector.

Open the downloaded `settings.json` file and update the following fields:

```json
{
  "clientId": "<Your Application (client) ID>",
  "tenant": "<Your Directory (tenant) ID>",
  "authorityUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<environment-specific-url>",
  "resource": "<environment-specific-resource-url>"
}
```

### Step 5: Create a New Connector Using Paconn

Finally, to create a new custom connector, you'll use the `paconn` CLI along with the `settings.json` file you have prepared:

```bash
paconn create --settings settings.json
```

This command uses the provided settings to authenticate and create the new connector within your specified environment.

### Conclusion

By carefully following these steps, you can successfully connect to GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments using the `paconn` CLI tool for Power Platform connectors. This setup enables secure and efficient management of connectors across different government cloud environments.
